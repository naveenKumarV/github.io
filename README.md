This is my webpage developed as a part of Spider Inductions web development Task 1. 
This webpage actually consists of a html file(index.html),an external stylesheet (main.css),an external javascript file(main.js) and an images folder which contains all images used in this webpage.
The images folder also contains screenshots of the calculator app in my mobile as well as that of the calculator in my webpage.

To replicate a working copy of my site on your local machine in the exact manner as it appears on the github.io page 
1.Open my repository. 
2.Download the repository to your local machine by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on right side of the github webpage and extract all the files in the downloaded zip-folder.
3.Click the index.html file in the folder. My webpage opens in your default browser.



You can also do it in another way.
First copy the content in the index.html, main.css , main.js from my repository into three separate files in a text editor give them the same names as I have given.
Also download the images folder from my repository and put the three files (html,css,js) and images folder in a new folder.
Now click the index.html file.
	
	
	
I tried to make the web page responsive by using percentages instead of pixels and adding media queries.
I kept the content of webpage in separate clickable tabs and used javascript function to accomplish this.
 
  
 The screen shots of the calculator in my mobile are below.
